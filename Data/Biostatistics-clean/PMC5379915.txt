The article by Nygaard et al. proposes that applying batch correction approaches to microarray data from studies with unbalanced designs may inadvertently exaggerate the differences observed. In seeking to illustrate their point, Nygaard et al. utilized a dataset (GSE61901) from a study we published (Towfic and others, 2014) and showed that one analysis pipeline utilizing the traditional approach to batch correction (ComBat) yielded over 1000 differentially expressed probesets, while an alternative approach proposed by Nygaard et al. (utilizing batch as a fixed effect and averaging technical replicates) recovered 11 differentially expressed probesets.

The article by Nygaard et al. proposes that applying batch correction approaches to microarray data from studies with unbalanced designs may inadvertently exaggerate the differences observed. In seeking to illustrate their point, Nygaard et al. utilized a dataset (GSE61901) from a study we published (Towfic and others, 2014) and showed that one analysis pipeline utilizing the traditional approach to batch correction (ComBat) yielded over 1000 differentially expressed probesets, while an alternative approach proposed by Nygaard et al. (utilizing batch as a fixed effect and averaging technical replicates) recovered 11 differentially expressed probesets.

While we agree with Nygaard et al.’s premise that the utilization of ANOVA or empirical-Bayes derived approaches to correct for batch effects may in certain cases overestimate significance, the approach they propose is surprisingly sensitive to differences in how data are preprocessed, specifically the handling of technical replicates. We therefore sought to identify alternate methods that address the points raised by Nygaard et al. These efforts yielded three alternative approaches for analyzing microarray data from studies with similar designs to ours, each of which adjusts for technical variation while avoiding the risks that Nygaard et al. described:

(i) Utilize the technical replicates as a random-effect variable in LIMMA.

(ii) Utilize the technical replicate as a random variable in a repeated-measures ANOVA.

(iii) Utilize a linear mixed-effects model to account for the technical replicate as a random effect while accounting for treatment as a fixed effect.

Each of the aforementioned methodologies is readily accessible through R’s base or Bioconductor packages.

Nygaard et al. referenced a study (GSE61901) we conducted (Towfic and others, 2014), in which we found significant and biologically relevant differences between the gene expression profiles induced by glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone), and the gene expression profiles induced by a generic GA (Glatimer\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
}{}$^{\mathrm{\circledR }}$\end{document}, Natco Pharma, Ltd., Hyderabad, India) using Illumina\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
}{}$^{\mathrm{\circledR }}$\end{document} Mouse-WG6 microarray chips. Each WG6 chip contains six microarrays, and each of the microarrays containing two physical strips that are to be treated as technical replicates (Shi and others, 2009). Because the distribution of the samples on each chip was heavily unbalanced (see supplementary Table 1 available at Biostatistics online), the dataset was initially analysed with ComBat including the treatments as covariates as required by the SVA package (Leek and others, 2012) and noted by Nygaard et al. The dataset was further analysed using various methods including two-way ANOVA and LIMMA yielding hundreds of differentially expressed probesets between GA and generic.

In contrast, Nygaard et al. performed an analysis in which all the technical replicates were averaged. After averaging all technical replicates, Nygaard et al. utilized the chip ID as a blocking variable in the analysis model, finding 11 probesets that pass FDR cutoff of 0.05. Another approach is to utilize the duplicateCorrelation feature recommended by LIMMA’s authors for handling technical replicates from Illumina WG-6 BeadChips (Shi and others, 2009). While averaging technical replicates has been suggested in the literature in cases where a t-test or two-way ANOVA will be utilized for downstream analysis (Cui and Churchill, 2003), the utilization of models that can account for both technical as well as biological variation is an alternative approach to maximize power of the statistical test (Chen and others, 2004; Cui and Churchill, 2003; Smyth and others, 2005). When GSE61901 is utilized and duplicateCorrelation is applied to account for the technical replicates, we find that the approach proposed by Nygaard et al. of blocking for batch effect in LIMMA identifies 1474 differentially expressed probesets. Thus, the results of Nygaard et al.’s proposed batch correction method differ dramatically depending upon how a dataset is preprocessed.

Upon further investigation, a variety of different preprocessing and batch correction methods all yield far more differentially expressed genes than the method proposed by Nygaard et al. Table 1 reports the results of various analyses we have conducted using a variety of techniques including LIMMA (Shi and others, 2009, duplicateCorrelation method: Smyth, 2013; Smyth and others, 2005) and mixed-effects ANOVA that are specifically designed to analyze unbalanced designs without reducing power (Bernal-Rusiel and others, 2013; Littell and others, 2002; Smyth, 2014). Code for these analyses is publicly available at https://github.com/immuneering/biostat_reply. Such methods take into account correlations between repeated measurements from the same subject/biological sample. These findings strongly suggest that the differences between GA and generic are robust to changes in batch correction and analysis methodologies, and support the key conclusions of Towfic et al.

In summary, we present three different methods for analyzing microarray data that utilize technical replicates while correcting for batch effects. These methods yield consistent results, and therefore represent robust alternatives to traditional batch correction methods in datasets subject to the concerns articulated by Nygaard et al.
