indicates that, even when somewhat misspecified, regression models based on the Dirichlet
negative multinomial distribution have smaller median absolute error than generalized
estimating equations, with a particularly pronounced improvement when correlation between
observations in a cluster is high. Estimation of explanatory variable effects and sources
of variation is illustrated for a study of clinical trial recruitment.

Dirichlet negative multinomialLongitudinal count dataRegressionSources of variation
==== Body
1. Introduction
In a recent study of recruitment of patients into clinical trials, multi-disciplinary
oncology teams (hereafter termed MDTs) were followed longitudinally. The number of patients
approached to enter clinical trials was recorded in successive 6-month periods. Analysis of
these figures highlighted the importance of understanding the nature and sources of
variation in count data, and underlying approach rates.

A natural approach to modeling longitudinal count data would be through a generalized
linear mixed model (GLMM) with Poisson distributions conditional on random effects. However,
there are situations when a marginal modeling approach might be preferred. For example, the
effect of explanatory variables at the population-averaged level (marginal effects) would be
of interest if these variables were defined by genetic marker information, which is
time-invariant and for which subject-specific effects would be less attractive conceptually.
In our study of trial recruitment, we were interested in intervention effects on the
population as a whole, rather than the recruitment performance of individual MDTs. An
additional advantage of marginal modeling, especially in contrast to models with
subject-specific conditional explanatory variable effects, is that it has been shown to
offer some degree of robustness for the estimation of regression parameters when departure
from the underlying assumed random effect structure occurs (Heagerty and Kurland, 2001).

One way of employing a marginal model would be to make use of generalized estimating
equation (GEE) methods (Solis-Trapala and Farewell,
2005). However, GEE methods do not provide direct information on sources of
variation, and there is a cost in efficiency compared with parametric maximum-likelihood
estimationQ4. Bearing this in mind, alternatives were investigated, and an analysis based on
the Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution appeared to be potentially useful.

The Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution is a discrete multivariate distribution
having support on the non-negative integers, and has been well characterized by Mosimann (1963), Leeds and Gelfand(1989), and Johnson and others (1997)Q5. However, the typical formulation, in
terms of a negative multinomial distribution compounded by a Dirchlet distribution, is
unappealing in a regression context; we provide a more natural random effects description. A
parameterization for this adaptation is given in the following sections and an illustrative
analysis of the motivating data is provided subsequently. We also discuss the results of a
small simulation study that explores model robustness and finite-sample behavior.

2. Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution
Consider a sequence of independent and identically distributed multinomial trials, each of
which has 1+m possible outcomes. Call one of the outcomes a
“success”, and suppose it has probability p0. The
other m outcomes have probabilities
p1,…,pm and
describe distinct types of “failure”. If the vector
(y1,…,ym)
counts the m types of failure until y0>0
successes are observed, then
(y1,…,ym)
is said to have a negative multinomial distribution with parameters
(y0,p0,…,pm).
Just as in the negative binomial (Pólya) case, y0 need
not be an integer: the negative multinomial distribution remains well defined when
y0 takes any positive real value.

Now suppose that, for each set of multinomial trials, the probabilities
p0,…,pm are
themselves sampled randomly from a Dirichlet distribution, having positive parameters
α0,…,αm.
The resulting distribution of
(y1,…,ym)
is then called Dirichlet (more generically, compound) negative multinomial. It has
2+m parameters, namely
y0,α0,…,αm.
As shown by Mosimann (1963), the joint
probability mass function of
(y1,…,ym)
so-distributed is  (2.1) \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

}{}\begin{equation*}\label{eq2.1} \frac{\Gamma(y_{\bullet})}{\Gamma(y_{0})\prod_{j = 1}^{m}\Gamma(y_{j} + 1)} \times \frac{\Gamma(\alpha_{\bullet})}{\prod_{j = 0}^{m}\Gamma(\alpha_{j})} \times \frac{\prod_{j = 0}^{m}\Gamma(y_{j} + \alpha_{j})}{\Gamma(y_{\bullet} + \alpha_{\bullet})}, \end{equation*}\end{document}  where
y•=y0+⋯+ym
and
α•=α0+⋯+αm.
The Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution has a finite mean when
α0>1, and a finite mean and covariance when
α0>2 (Mosimann,
1963). Heuristically, these constraints can be thought of as placing upper bounds
on the variance of the underlying Dirichlet distribution.

An informative alternative to the foregoing, traditional, derivation of the Dirichlet
negative multinomial distribution proceeds as follows. Let
y1,…,ym be
independent Poisson variables with mean values
λ1t,…,λmt.
If t∼Ga(y0,y0)
(shape=rate=y0) and the
λj are fixed and known, then
(y1,…,ym)
has a negative multinomial distribution. Alternatively, if the
λj are positive random variables of a particular
form, then the Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution results.

Interestingly, the required distributional form for the
λ1,…,λm is not the seemingly
natural independent gamma construction, but instead a further hierarchical structure where
each λj has a gamma distribution with shape
αj and a common, random rate parameter
λ0∼Ga(α0,y0)
that induces correlation in the λj. This three-level
formulation results in the same Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution as in (2.1), with parameters
y0,α0,…,αm.
Marginally, the λj have compound-gamma (a special case of
the generalized beta-prime) distributions (Dubey,
1970). We see that restrictions on α0 correspond
directly to restrictions on the skewness of the distribution of λ0.

3. Regression formulation
Mosimann (1963) reports the mean of the
Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution, but omits its derivation. Our alternative,
random effects formulation of the Dirichlet negative multinomial provides a direct route:
since t has unit mean, the expectation of
yj is simply the mean of
λj, which in turn has a compound-gamma distribution
whose first moment is
αjy0/(α0−1)
when α0>1. Mosimann (1963) also reports variances and covariances of the Dirichlet negative
multinomial distribution, and these can similarly be derived from the random effects
formulation. Applying the law of total covariance twice, it easily follows that for
j≠k,
cov(yj,yk)=E(yj)E(yk)var(t)+cov(λj,λk)(1+var(t)).
The required
cov(λj,λk) can either
be determined directly from their bivariate compound gamma distribution (Hutchinson, 1981) or by a third application of the
same law. Either way, we find (for j≠k) that

var(yj)=var(λj)+E(λj)(1+var(t)),
which simplifies to  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

It is apparent from the form of the variance and covariance that the parameterization in
terms of the αj and
y0 is far from ideal for regression purposes. At a minimum, we
would like to parameterize in terms of the means
μ1,…,μm
of the vector random variable
(y1,…,ym),
and have the flexibility to say
E(yj)=μj.
This is satisfied if we write
αj=μj×(α0−1)/y0.
Additionally, we should like the remaining two parameters to convey something meaningful
about the variance structures in the model. We suggest writing
φNM=1/y0 and
φNB=y0/(α0−1);
the notation is suggestive of the interpretation we ascribe to these parameters in the
following section, linked to negative multinomial and negative binomial variation,
respectively. A Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution with parameters

is therefore a candidate regression model for correlated count data. The regression
specification is completed by setting

For observations on multiple individuals, the full likelihood function will be defined in
the usual way as a product over all Dirichlet negative multinomial observations of terms of
the form (2.1). Expressions for
likelihood derivatives are provided in supplemental electronic material (available at Biostatistics
online), together with R code to fit the foregoing regression model.

4. Interpretation
The Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution has been used most extensively when
modeling the allocation of an unknown number of items (such as product purchases) to a known
set of categories (such as individual brands), as for example in Goodhardt and others (1984). In such contexts
formulating a model in terms of a negative binomial total with Dirichlet multinomial
category probabilities is sensible and interpretable. However, when used as a model for
longitudinal (more generically, repeated measures) count data, the concept of category
probabilities has no substantive meaning: the number of “categories” could vary
from subject to subject, and the total number of “items” is unlikely to reflect
any important aspect of the scientific problem. Neither is it natural to extend the notion
of categories to regression on other variables, and Goodhardt and others (1984) provide no such extension. In
contrast, the Gamma random effect construction offers a more familiar perspective. Subjects
have one shared and as many observation-specific random effects as needed, and these act on
the marginal mean in the manner of a generalized linear model.

An alternative regression formulation of the Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution to
that given in Section3 was developed by Hausman
and others (1984) in the econometric context of studying the
relationship between patents and expenditure by research & development.Q6 This was based
on adopting a negative binomial model for each
yj with probability function  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\usepackage{amssymb}

\begin{document}
}{}\[ \frac{\Gamma(\mu_{j}\delta + y_{j})}{\Gamma(\mu_{j}\delta) \Gamma(y_{j}+1)} \times \left(\frac{\delta}{1 + \delta}\right)^{\mu_{j}\delta} \times \left(\frac{1}{1 + \delta}\right)^{y_{j}}, \] \end{document}  where the overdispersion parameter (δ in their
notation) is the same for all yj from the same
individual or unit of observation. For reasons of mathematical convenience, Hausman and others (1984) then
assumed that the δ for an individual or a unit is a random variable
where
δ/(1+δ)∼Beta(a,b).
Conceptually, within-unit variation is reflected in the negative binomial assumption, which
corresponds to a Poisson model with gamma random effects while between-unit variation is
introduced by random variation in the δ values. However, no
interpretation was presented for the parameters a and b,
and it was recognized by Hausman and
others (1984) that no investigation of the two variance components could
be made. Once again, category probabilities, implicit in the underlying Beta distribution,
offer little insight into this aspect of the model.

Comparison of the form of the resulting probability function with Equation(2.1) reveals that
a=α0 and that
b=y0. This form of the model has been
implemented in the Stata package xtnbreg, where the linear predictor is linked to
\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

\begin{document}
}{}$\log (\mu _{j} / \varphi _{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm {NB}})$\end{document}
rather than the μj and therefore the
location term would be the sum of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}
}{}$\log (\varphi _{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm {NB}})$\end{document}
and the location term derived from a fit of the model under our proposed formulation.

Arguably, the random effects formulation of the Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution
simply makes it clear that there is no straightforward interpretation of the dispersion
parameters. Since
(λj|λ0)∼Ga(μj/φNB,λ0)
and
λ0∼Ga(1/(φNMφNB)+1,1/φNM),
we see that the parameter φNM influences the variance of
observation-specific (λj) as well as the shared
(t) random effects, while the λj
themselves induce a small amount of correlation in the
yj.

However, the limiting behavior is informative about their respective roles: consider the
limit as φNM→0. The random effects t
and λ0 degenerate to 1 and 1/φNB,
respectively, meaning that the only remaining random effects are the (now independent)
λj∼Ga(μj/φNB,1/φNB).
We deduce that, as φNM→0, the distribution of
(y1,…,ym)
converges to independent negative binomial distributions, having parameters
μj/φNB
specifying the number of successes, 1/(1+φNB) the
success probability and
φNB/(1+φNB) the
failure probability. As φNB→0, the
λj degenerate to point masses on the
μj, and hence the distribution of
(y1,…,ym)
converges to a negative multinomial distribution with parameters
μ0,μ0/μ•,…,μm/μ•.
Here, we have written
μ•=μ0+⋯+μm
and (since it is the correct limit) \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{wasysym} 
\usepackage{amsfonts} 
\usepackage{amssymb} 
\usepackage{amsbsy}
\usepackage{upgreek}
\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}
\begin{document}
}{}$\mu _{0} = \varphi _{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm {NM}}^{-1}$\end{document}.

Taken together, these two limiting results indicate that
φNB is linked mainly to within-unit variation across
time. In contrast, φNM is related to variation between
units. Aside from the boundary cases just described, the interplay between
φNM and φNB will
typically be fairly complex, both capturing some elements of between- and within-cluster
variation. We can, however, make use of Mosimann's observation that the covariance
matrix of a Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution is just a scalar multiple of that of
the related negative multinomial distribution. The relevant overdispersion constant is given
by the expression  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{wasysym} 
\usepackage{amsfonts} 
\usepackage{amssymb} 
\usepackage{amsbsy}
\usepackage{upgreek}
\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}
\begin{document}
}{}\[ C = \frac{\alpha_{0} - 1 + y_{0}}{\alpha_{0} - 2} = \frac{1 + \varphi_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm NB}}{1 - \varphi_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm NM}\varphi_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm NB}}. \] \end{document}  In the limiting cases we have discussed, this overdispersion constant tends
to 1+φNB (when
φNM→0) and 1 (when
φNB→0). For small values of
φNMφNB, then,
φNB can be seen crudely as quantifying the amount of
extra-negative multinomial variation present in the data.

Another way of understanding the relative contributions of between- and within-unit
variation is to compare the variance of t (which has mean 1) with the
covariance matrix of the λj, holding the mean values of
the latter also equal to 1. When
μj=μk=1,
the covariance of λj and
λk is
(δjk+φNM)φNB/(1−φNMφNB),
while the variance of t is φNM
irrespective of the values of the μj. This
comparison puts t and λj on an equal
footing; it allows us to investigate how the variability in such a set of observations is
spread across the between- and within-unit random effects. On this scale, a direct
comparison of variances is meaningful. This approach is illustrated in the following
section.

Finally, we suggest similar examination of the estimated covariance matrix for two
observations having unit or some other convenient mean. From (3.1), we have that when
μj=μk=1,
 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

}{}\[ \mathrm{cov}(y_{j}, y_{k}) = (\delta_{jk} + \varphi_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm NM}) \times \frac{1 + \varphi_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm NB}}{1 - \varphi_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm NM} \varphi_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm NB}}. \] \end{document}  Although not at all specific to our random effects formulation, we think
that this offers the most direct insight into the variance structures present in the model.
For more generality, we could consider the covariance matrix over a range of possible mean
values, or plot the variance and covariance as a function of unspecified means
μj and
μk.

5. Simulation study
To explore the usefulness of regression based on the Dirichlet negative multinomial
distribution, we conducted a small simulation study. We generated data from two, similar
models: one was Dirichlet negative multinomial, and the other a related
Gamma–Gamma–Poisson model. In both instances, we put
(yj|λj,t)∼Poi(λjt)
for j=1,…,m and
t∼Ga(1/φNM,1/φNM),
and in both we set \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}
\begin{document}
}{}$\log (\mu _{j}) = \beta _{0} + x_{1} \beta _{1} + x_{2} \beta _{2}$\end{document},
where x1 was an equiprobable binary covariate and
x2 a standard Gaussian covariate. The difference between the
models lay in the specification of the λj; one employed
the compound gamma setup that results in our Dirichlet negative multinomial model, the other
used independent gamma variables
λj∼Ga(μjφNB,φNB).
These competing models allowed us to investigate the performance of Dirichlet negative
multinomial regression when it is, and is not, correctly specified.

In all simulations,
β0=β1=β2=1.
We used sample sizes n=50,100, and unit sizes
m=5,10, and for each of these four combinations we considered all
nine combinations of φNM=0.25,0.5,0.75 and
φNB=0.25,0.5,0.75. We compared the performance of
Dirichlet negative multinomial regression with a Poisson GEE using an exchangeable working
correlation structure, and focus our reporting on the median absolute error. We use the
median absolute error rather than root mean squared error because, in a small percentage of
cases, the GEE routine either failed to converge or converged to implausible parameter
estimates; since these would be noticed by any competent analyst, median absolute error
constituted a fairer comparison of performance, being less sensitive to a few suspect
estimates.

Table1 reports the results for
n=100, m=5; other results are
qualitatively similar, and tables giving details may be found in the online appendix
(available at Biostatistics online). We note that, within these
simulations, Dirichlet negative multinomial regression is uniformly preferable to the GEE
approach in terms of median absolute error, and in almost all cases the best 50% of
estimates lie within 10% of the true value. Improvements over GEEs were particularly
marked for the coefficient β2 of the continuous covariate
x2, in some cases showing a 4-fold improvement in median
absolute error. Table 1. For n=100,m=5, median absolute error

Interestingly, the biggest gains in efficiency are found when
φNM=0.75 and
φNB=0.25. This corresponds to the largest
correlation between observations within a unit that we explored in our simulations, and it
seems that in such cases modeling the variance (even incorrectly) leads to useful
improvements in estimation. Note that the apparently superior performance of both models
under the Gamma–Gamma–Poisson setup owes simply to the fact that the variance of
the data is smaller here: the compounding gamma distribution is absent, so the only
meaningful comparisons in the table are vertical ones.

Table2 summarizes the estimation of the
variance parameters for Dirichlet negative multinomial regression. Recall that
φNM and φNB have
different meanings under the two data-generation setups; nevertheless, the proximity of the
mean estimates that arise under the Dirichlet negative multinomial assumption to the true
values of φNM and φNB even
under the Gamma–Gamma–Poisson setup lend empirical support to our interpretation
of these two parameters. As expected, the approximation becomes less satisfactory as the
product φNMφNB increases.
Even when the model is correctly specified, there is some underestimation of the variance
components. This, too, is to be expected; bias of variance component estimates toward the
null in small samples is a well-known feature of maximum-likelihood inference in random
effect models. When the Dirichlet negative multinomial model was correctly specified, median
absolute error in the estimation of φNM and
φNB (not tabulated) varied between about 0.05 and 0.15,
increasing with φNM and
φNB and decreasing with sample size; this indicates that
small, moderate, and large values of the variance components can be fairly reliably
distinguished, even in small samples. Table 2. For n=100,m=5, mean estimates of

6. Analysis of motivating example
Data available for analysis from the study outlined in the introduction consisted of number
of patients approached over 3 consecutive 6-month periods for 12 MDTs and over 4 consecutive
6-month periods for another 10 MDTs. In addition, a variety of factors thought to influence
approach rates were recorded, including whether the MDT worked in a specialist center or a
district general hospital, whether there was more than one research nurse in the team and
the number of trials in the team's portfolio during the 6-month period (which, for
illustration, is used here as a binary indicator variable for more than five trials). The
latter variable may vary across periods, while the first two will not.

The first five rows of Table3 present the
results of fitting five different marginal regression models to these data. The regression
coefficient for Hospital Type is similar across all models except the Dirichlet negative
multinomial, for which the estimate is somewhat smaller. The effect of having multiple
nurses increases slightly for the latter three models compared with the first two while the
coefficient for number of trials is decreased in the last three models. Table 3. For the trial recruitment data, comparative results from a variety of regression
models. Standard errors are shown in parentheses for each fixed effect

Negative binomial	1.08 (0.189)	0.62 (0.212)	0.61 (0.185)	
Negative multinomial	1.14 (0.197)	0.75 (0.197)	0.32 (0.115)	
Negative multinomial (GEE)	1.14 (0.273)	0.75 (0.269)	0.32 (0.189)	
Dirichlet negative multinomial	0.93 (0.246)	0.68 (0.276)	0.36 (0.189)	
GLMM (Poisson)	1.08 (0.259)	0.74 (0.292)	0.44 (0.199)	
GLMM (negative binomial)	1.07 (0.260)	0.72 (0.295)	0.45 (0.207)	


The Poisson model, as expected, has the smallest estimated standard errors for the
regression coefficients. One extra variance component is present in the negative binomial
and negative multinomial models and these models show comparable increases in the estimated
standard errors for the fixed explanatory variables related to hospital type and the number
of research nurses. However, for the variable related to the number of trials recruiting
then the standard error is larger for the negative binomial model than for the negative
multinomial model. The robust standard errors for the negative multinomial model are larger
than the model-based estimates and comparable with those from the Dirichlet negative
multinomial model, which has two extra variance components compared with the Poisson
model.

The dispersion parameter for the negative binomial model was estimated as 2.35; this
corresponds to a variance of 0.43 for a gamma distribution from which random effects are
generated for each observed 6-month period of observation. In contrast, the negative
multinomial corresponds to random effects associated with each MDT and the variance of the
assumed gamma distribution for these effects was estimated as 0.28.

The estimated values of φNM and
φNB from the Dirichlet negative multinomial were 0.062
and 2.8, respectively. The much smaller value for φNM
suggests that there may be more variation within an MDT's observations than between
teams and the estimated overdispersion factor for extra-negative multinomial variation is
C=4.6. Because φNM and
φNB are not directly comparable, it is also informative
to look at the covariance matrix of the underlying λj
assuming unit means, as outlined in the section describing parameter interpretation. The
standard deviation of t is 0.25, while the standard deviation of a single
λj when
μj=1 is 2.14, nearly an order of
magnitude larger. To indicate that this variation is indeed largely within-team, we note
that the correlation of distinct
λj,λk is just
0.059.

As another illustration, consider a period for which the average number of patients
approached is 13.8, the observed mean across periods in the data set. With this mean the
estimated standard deviation for an observation from the Dirichlet negative multinomial
model would be 10.86. In contrast, the estimated standard deviation from the negative
binomial model would be 9.75 and from the negative multinomial model would be 8.16. This
demonstrates that there is somewhat more variation within teams than between teams, although
we emphasize again that either parameter will pick up some of both types of variation if the
other is not included in the model. We note that the (model-based) correlation between
numbers of patients approached by a team in distinct 6-month periods each with mean 13.8 is
estimated to be just 0.13, emphasizing the extent of variability within the observations on
a single MDT.

For comparison purposes, the penultimate row of Table3 gives the results of fitting a generalized linear Poisson mixed model (with both
between- and within-MDT random effects) to these data, using the lme4 package in R (Bates and others, 2012; Core Team, 2012. The estimated coefficients and
standard errors can be seen to be similar to the Dirichlet negative multinomial model. The
between- and within-team estimated standard deviations of the Gaussian random effects were
0.461 and 0.458. This model can be thought of as λj
having a log-Normal distribution with parameters
θj and
σ2w and t having a
log-Normal distribution with parameters 0 and
σ2b. When these both have unit mean, their
variances are \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

respectively, indicating that the breakdown of variation into these two components is
slightly more comparable within this modeling framework than under a marginal model. The
final row of Table3 shows the results of
fitting a GLMM with Gaussian random effects between-MDTs but with negative binomial
residuals, using the glmmADMB package in R (Fournier
and others, 2012; Skaug
and others, 2012; because the standard deviations of the
within-team gamma (0.457) and between-team Gaussian (0.467) random effects are comparable
with those from the Gaussian GLMM, it is unsurprising that the estimated fixed effects are
also rather similar.

A further example of substantive analysis using a Dirichlet negative multinomial regression
model can be found in the supplementary material (available at Biostatistics
online).

7. Discussion
The purpose of this note is to highlight the availability of a convenient marginal
regression model for count data with an explicit introduction of between- and within-unit
variation. The choice between a marginal or conditional random effects model will typically
be application-specific, although some possible advantages to the marginal approach have
been discussed. If a marginal model is desired, then the Dirichlet negative multinomial
model provides a convenient structure for this purpose, and can provide efficiency gains
over GEEs. In particular, having separate mean parameters for each component and two
variance parameters makes it suitable for use with unbalanced longitudinal count data with a
time-invariant covariance structure.

The lack of separability of the variance components is a weakness of the Dirichlet negative
multinomial regression model. The resulting difficulty of interpreting these parameters will
often be outweighed by the ease of fitting, and comparing, multiple fixed effects structures
without the need for numerical approximation of likelihoods. It is also worth reflecting
that, outside of linear models, functional links between means and variances almost always
result in difficulty in interpreting variance parameters; the Dirichlet negative multinomial
is no different in this regard to, say, the Poisson GLMM used for comparison purposes in our
motivating example.
